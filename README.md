# tarmeez-social-media
Tarmeez Social Website project was originally part of an advanced JavaScript course presented by Mr Yarub Al-Mustafa through his "Tarmeez" channel on YouTube. The project was implemented using only JavaScript, without any frameworks, but with the Bootstrap library. Afterwards, I followed a React course by Mr Yarub and wanted to practically apply what I learned. I found that the Social Coding Website project was very suitable for this purpose and posed a significant challenge for me, as it was originally written in JavaScript only, as I mentioned earlier. Therefore, I wrote the code for the Tarmeez Social Website project using the React framework and the MUI interface library. Many thanks to Yarub for the React course and for providing the project API.
